    <p>Specifies a ruby annotation.<br>

        A ruby annotation is a small extra text, attached to 
        the main text to indicate the pronunciation 
        or meaning of the corresponding characters.<br> T
        his kind of annotation is often used in Japanese 
        publications.<br>
        
        Use "ruby" together with "rt" and "rp":<br> 
        The "ruby" element consists of one or more characters 
            that needs an explanation/pronunciation, and an 
            "rt" element that gives that information, and an 
        optional "rp" element that defines what to 
        show for browsers that do not support ruby 
        annotations.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<ruby>
    漢 <rt> ㄏㄢˋ </rt>
